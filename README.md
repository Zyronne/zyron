## 📌 Executive Summary & Track Fit

### The Core Problem in an AI-Native Internet
AI has permanently altered assumptions about code generation and digital provenance: autonomous agents can synthesize, deploy, and interact with smart contracts in milliseconds. However, **how does an on-chain protocol, DeFi vault, or peer AI agent trust that bytecode is secure, authentic, and uncompromised without relying on a centralized, closed Web2 platform?**

### Zyron's Solution
Zyron is an **On-Chain Trust, Attestation & Invariant Verification Primitive** built natively for Monad. It decouples security validation from centralized gatekeepers, establishing a composable, non-capturable trust layer where:
1. **Autonomous Invariant Verification (ERC-8004 Validation Layer)**: AI agents and native Foundry host runners synthesize and prove live EVM execution traces against state invariants.
2. **Cryptographic Content Passports (Track Prompt #02)**: Every verified contract bytecode is bound to a SHA-256 binary hash, a Merkleized findings tree, and decentralized IPFS proof artifacts, sealed into an on-chain ERC-721 Soulbound Security Seal.
3. **Decentralized Trust Passports (Track Prompt #06)**: Human auditors and verification agents earn non-transferable, portable on-chain skill credentials verified across Monad without middlemen.
4. **On-Chain Composability (`GuardedByZyron`)**: Any Monad DeFi protocol or agent can enforce attestation gates in 5 lines of Solidity before accepting token deposits or routing calls.

## ⚡ Leveraging Monad's Native Primitives

| Monad Feature | How Zyron Leverages It |
|---|---|
| **Native P256 / WebAuthn Precompile** | Frictionless biometric passkey signing (TouchID/FaceID) via Privy embedded wallets, producing verifiable EIP-712/P-256 signatures with 0 gas cost to the user. |
| **ERC-8004 Trustless Agent Standard** | Functions as the **Validation & Reputation Registry** for autonomous AI agents on Monad, recording verifiable task execution and invariant proofs. |
| **BTX Encrypted Mempools** | Guarantees confidential disclosure during exploit triage, preventing MEV searchers from frontrunning disclosed 0-days before mitigations are sealed. |
| **10,000 TPS Parallel EVM** | Makes continuous, per-commit on-chain attestation economically and practically viable at sub-cent gas fees. |

## 🚀 Quickstart: Developer Integration in 5 Lines

Any protocol or AI agent on Monad can guard their contract interactions using [`GuardedByZyron.sol`](file:///Users/basil/Desktop/codes/Zyron-Monad/zyron-contracts/src/examples/GuardedByZyron.sol):

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.24;

import "@zyron/contracts/GuardedByZyron.sol";

contract SafeVault is GuardedByZyron {
    // Pass the deployed ZyronAttestation address on Monad Testnet
    constructor() GuardedByZyron(0xBd24D2BFFbc69a17aCe69aaF930fC4e0d979c4D3) {}

    // Restricts interaction strictly to bytecodes with an active on-chain Zyron attestation
    function depositCollateral(address token) external onlyAttestedTarget(token) {
        // Safe: Token bytecode is cryptographically verified on Monad!
    }
}
```

See [INTEGRATION.md](./INTEGRATION.md) for full SDK and contract documentation.
